# Francesco's Home Page
A Dynamic home page written in js, highly inspired by Zorin's one, but with extra features, such as:
1) **URL Mode**: If an URL is typed in the Search Box, pressing Enter (or clicking it) will open it;
2) **Eval Mode**: If the ``.$`` prefix is added before anything you wrote, pressing Enter will evaluate the code in the and show the result of the evaluation;
3) **A Settings Page**: You can open it via the ``.$settings()`` command;
4) **Dynamic Search Engines**: You can add custom search engines in the settings;
5) **Dynamic Bookmarks**: Same thing as before;
6) **Languages Support**: If your browser uses one of the already added languages, it'll apply it automatically, else you can choose one of them in the settings. I added some language just for testing how well it works (not that much but it's still something), but I'd accept any other language addition, even dumb ones.
